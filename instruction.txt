// Make a file in any wya you want (eg. gedit, vim, etc.)
// Can also make directories (using mkdir)

//OPTION-
gedit .gitignore
	--> add the name of the file you don't want to upload (eg. log.txt, etc.)
	    add a file in each line
	    can also add a directory like, /dir1
	    even (*.txt) and all also work
	    

git add <file_name>
or
git add .	(to add all the files)

git status	(to check the status: red implies not added, if added then green)

git commit -m "<your commit>"

// Now you need to push

git push --> then, anikettle --> <password>	(worked for me)

// Not yet sure of branching

git push -u origin master	(didn't work for me: not yet figured out the reason)

git branch mybranch
git checkout mybranch

\\ Do the changes as before, then add, then commit

git checkout master (or main: whatever was the original directory)
	NOTE: the changes made in the branch is gone! as those changes are in the login branch

git merge mybranch
	enter some comments on merging (editor opens in the terminal itself)
	NOTE: Now the branch files are visible

git push	(should work)




IF MAKING A REPO ON THE PC AND THEN WANT TO PUT IT ON A REPO

git init
git add readme.md
git commit -m "inti commit"

git remote add origin https://github.com/anikettle/git_hub_ubuntu.git
git push -origin master
